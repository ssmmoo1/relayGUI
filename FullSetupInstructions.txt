    ###############

The first set of options are colors
    You can find a list of colors you can choose from here https://wiki.tcl.tk/37701
    If you want to change a color then delete the words between the quotes and replace it with the color you want.
    Keep the capitalization exactly as it shows on the website
    Don't change anything outside of the quotes

Next is the font size
    You can change the number between the quotes if you want a larger or smaller font

    The next several options are for the text on the buttons
    You can replace the words in the quotes with the text that you want to appear on the button
    The buttons are labeled 1-6
    1 being the left most button and 6 being the bottom left button

The next several options are for the image that you want on the button
    To change the image on the button the image must be the right correct size and also be in the "images" folder for the program to find it
    Change the name between the quotes to the exact name of the picture you want in the images folder. Make sure you include the file extension

    The image sizes must be the following
    buttonN Image: width x height

    button1 Image: 100x300
    button2 Image: 150x300
    button3,4,5,6 Image: 185x150

The final option is the active time for the actuator
    This value is NOT in quotes
    This value is the time in seconds
    Delete the number and you can replace it with any whole number
    Do not use a decimal point
    This will be the time the relay is open for when a button is pressed in seconds
